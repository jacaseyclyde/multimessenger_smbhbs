  abstract = {We map the co-eval growth of galaxies and their central supermassive  black holes in detail by measuring the incidence of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in galaxies as a function of star formation rate (SFR) and redshift (to z {$\sim$} 4). We combine large galaxy samples with deep Chandra X-ray imaging to measure the probability distribution of specific black hole accretion rates (LX relative to stellar mass) and derive robust AGN fractions and average specific accretion rates. First, we consider galaxies along the main sequence of star formation. We find a linear correlation between the average SFR and both the AGN fraction and average specific accretion rate across a wide range in stellar mass (M\_*{$\sim$} 10\^\{8.5-11.5\} M\_\textbackslash odot) and to at least z {$\sim$} 2.5, indicating that AGNs in main-sequence galaxies are driven by the stochastic accretion of cold gas. We also consider quiescent galaxies and find significantly higher AGN fractions than predicted, given their low SFRs, indicating that AGNs in quiescent galaxies are fuelled by additional mechanisms (e.g. stellar winds). Next, we bin galaxies according to their SFRs relative to the main sequence. We find that the AGN fraction is significantly elevated for galaxies that are still star forming but with SFRs below the main sequence, indicating further triggering mechanisms enhance AGN activity within these sub-main-sequence galaxies. We also find that the incidence of high accretion rate AGN is enhanced in starburst galaxies and evolves more mildly with redshift than within the rest of the galaxy population, suggesting mergers play a role in driving AGN activity in such high-SFR galaxies.},

We augment standard pulsar timing models with the addition of time-variable dispersion measure and frequency variable pulse shape terms. We apply our techniques to the Five Year Data Release from the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves. We find that there is no evidence for the presence of a detectable continuous gravitational wave; however, we can use these data to place the most constraining upper limits to date on the strength of such gravitational waves. Using the full 17 pulsar data set we place a 95\% upper limit on the strain amplitude of h0 {$\lessequivlnt$} 3.0 \texttimes{} 10-14 at a frequency of 10 nHz. Furthermore, we place 95\% sky-averaged lower limits on the luminosity distance to such gravitational wave sources, finding that dL {$\greaterequivlnt$} 425 Mpc for sources at a frequency of 10 nHz and chirp mass 1010 M{$\Sun$}. We find that for gravitational wave sources near our best timed pulsars in the sky, the sensitivity of the pulsar timing array is increased by a factor of {$\sim$}four over the sky-averaged sensitivity.

  abstract = {We search for an isotropic stochastic gravitational-wave background (GWB) in the \$12.5\$-year pulsar timing data set collected by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav). Our analysis finds strong evidence of a stochastic process, modeled as a power-law, with common amplitude and spectral slope across pulsars. The Bayesian posterior of the amplitude for a \$f\^\{-2/3\}\$ power-law spectrum, expressed as characteristic GW strain, has median \$1.92 \textbackslash times 10\^\{-15\}\$ and \$5\textbackslash\%\$--\$95\textbackslash\%\$ quantiles of \$1.37\$--\$2.67 \textbackslash times 10\^\{-15\}\$ at a reference frequency of \$f\_\textbackslash mathrm\{yr\} = 1 \textasciitilde\textbackslash mathrm\{yr\}\^\{-1\}\$. The Bayes factor in favor of the common-spectrum process versus independent red-noise processes in each pulsar exceeds \$10,000\$. However, we find no statistically significant evidence that this process has quadrupolar spatial correlations, which we would consider necessary to claim a GWB detection consistent with General Relativity. We find that the process has neither monopolar nor dipolar correlations, which may arise from, for example, reference clock or solar-system ephemeris systematics, respectively. The amplitude posterior has significant support above previously reported upper limits; we explain this in terms of the Bayesian priors assumed for intrinsic pulsar red noise. We examine potential implications for the supermassive black hole binary population under the hypothesis that the signal is indeed astrophysical in nature.},

  abstract = {We use a large sample of galaxies from the Two Micron All Sky Survey  (2MASS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to calculate galaxy luminosity and stellar mass functions in the local universe. We estimate corrections for passband shifting and galaxy evolution, as well as present-day stellar mass-to-light (M/L) ratios, by fitting the optical-near-infrared galaxy data with simple models. Accounting for the 8\% galaxy overdensity in the SDSS early data release region, the optical and near-infrared luminosity functions we construct for this sample agree with most recent literature optical and near-infrared determinations within the uncertainties. We argue that 2MASS is biased against low surface brightness galaxies and use SDSS plus our knowledge of stellar populations to estimate the ``true'' K-band luminosity function. This has a steeper faint end slope and a slightly higher overall luminosity density than the direct estimate. Furthermore, assuming a universally applicable stellar initial mass function (IMF), we find good agreement between the stellar mass function we derive from the 2MASS/SDSS data and that derived by Cole et al. The faint end slope for the stellar mass function is steeper than -1.1, reflecting the low stellar M/L ratios characteristic of low-mass galaxies. We estimate an upper limit to the stellar mass density in the local universe {$\Omega$}*h=2.0+/-0.6\texttimes 10-3 by assuming an IMF as rich in low-mass stars as allowed by observations of galaxy dynamics in the local universe. The stellar mass density may be lower than this value if a different IMF with fewer low-mass stars is assumed. Finally, we examine type-dependence in the optical and near-infrared luminosity functions and the stellar mass function. In agreement with previous work, we find that the characteristic luminosity or mass of early-type galaxies is larger than for later types, and the faint end slope is steeper for later types than for earlier types. Accounting for typing uncertainties, we estimate that at least half, and perhaps as much as 3/4, of the stellar mass in the universe is in early-type galaxies. As an aid to workers in the field, we present in an Appendix the relationship between model stellar M/L ratios and colors in SDSS/2MASS passbands, an updated discussion of near-infrared stellar M/L ratio estimates, and the volume-corrected distribution of g- and K-band stellar M/L ratios as a function of stellar mass.},

  abstract = {It is now well established that galaxy interactions and mergers play a crucial role in the hierarchical growth of structure in our universe. Galaxy mergers can lead to the formation of elliptical galaxies and larger disk galaxies, as well as drive galaxy evolution through star formation and nuclear activity. During mergers, the nuclei of the individual galaxies come closer and finally form a double nuclei galaxy. Although mergers are common, the detection of double-nuclei galaxies (DNGs) is rare and fairly serendipitous. Their detection is very important as their properties can help us understand the formation of supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries, dual active galactic nuclei (DAGN), and the associated feedback effects. There is thus a need for an automatic/systematic survey of data for the discovery of double nuclei galaxies. Using the Sloan digital sky survey (SDSS) as the target catalog, we have introduced a novel algorithm "Gothic" (Graph-bOosTed iterated HIll Climbing) that detects whether a given image of a galaxy has characteristic features of a DNG (ASCL entry 2707). We have tested the algorithm on a random sample of 100,000 galaxies from the Stripe 82 region in SDSS and obtained a maximum detection rate of 4.2\% with a careful choice of the input catalog.},

Our measurements are consistent with other measurements of the growth of stellar mass with cosmic time and with estimates of the time evolution of the cosmic star formation rate. Intriguingly, the integrated stellar mass of blue galaxies with young stars has not significantly changed since z {$\sim$} 1, even though these galaxies host the majority of the star formation: instead, the growth of the total stellar mass density is dominated by the growth of the total mass in the largely passive galaxies on the red sequence.},

  abstract = {We perform numerical simulations of gravitational waves (GWs) induced by hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic turbulent sources that might have been present at cosmological quantum chromodynamic (QCD) phase transitions. For turbulent energies of about 4\% of the radiation energy density, the typical scale of such motions may have been a sizable fraction of the Hubble scale at that time. The resulting GWs are found to have an energy fraction of about \$10\^\{-9\}\$ of the critical energy density in the nHz range today and may already have been observed by the NANOGrav collaboration. This is further made possible by our findings of shallower spectra proportional to the square root of the frequency for nonhelical hydromagnetic turbulence. This implies more power at low frequencies than for the steeper spectra previously anticipated. The behavior toward higher frequencies depends strongly on the nature of the turbulence. For vortical hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic turbulence, there is a sharp drop of spectral GW energy by up to five orders of magnitude in the presence of helicity, and somewhat less in the absence of helicity. For acoustic hydrodynamic turbulence, the sharp drop is replaced by a power law decay, albeit with a rather steep slope. Our study supports earlier findings of a quadratic scaling of the GW energy with the magnetic energy of the turbulence and inverse quadratic scaling with the peak frequency, which leads to larger GW energies under QCD conditions.},

  abstract = {Using deep infrared observations conducted with the MOIRCS imager on the  Subaru Telescope in the northern GOODS field combined with public surveys in GOODS-S, we investigate the dependence on stellar mass, M *, and galaxy type of the close pair fraction (5 h -1 kpc {$<$} r sep {$<$} 20 h -1 kpc) and implied merger rate. In terms of combined depth and survey area, our publicly available mass-limited sample represents a significant improvement over earlier infrared surveys used for this purpose. In common with some recent studies, we find that the fraction of paired systems that could result in major mergers is low (\textasciitilde 4\%) and does not increase significantly with redshift to z {$\approx$} 1.2, with vprop(1 + z)1.6{$\pm$}1.6. Our key finding is that massive galaxies with M *{$>$}1011 M sun are more likely to host merging companions than less massive systems (M * \textasciitilde{} 1010 M sun). We find evidence for a higher pair fraction for red, spheroidal hosts compared to blue, late-type systems, in line with expectations based on clustering at small scales. The so-called "dry" mergers between early-type galaxies devoid of star formation (SF) represent nearly 50\% of close pairs with M *{$>$}3 \texttimes{} 1010 M sun at z \textasciitilde{} 0.5, but less than 30\% at z \textasciitilde{} 1. This result can be explained by the increasing abundance of red, early-type galaxies at these masses. We compare the volumetric merger rate of galaxies with different masses to mass-dependent trends in galaxy evolution. Our results reaffirm the conclusion of Bundy et al. that major mergers do not fully account for the formation of spheroidal galaxies since z \textasciitilde{} 1. In terms of mass assembly, major mergers contribute little to galaxy growth below M * \textasciitilde{} 3 \texttimes{} 1010 M sun but play a more significant role among galaxies with M * gsim 1011 M sun \textasciitilde{} 30\% of which have undergone mostly dry mergers over the observed redshift range. Overall, the relatively rapid and recent coalescence of high-mass galaxies mirrors the expected hierarchical growth of halos and is consistent with recent model predictions, even if the top-down suppression of SF and morphological evolution (i.e., "downsizing") involves additional physical processes. Based on observations collected at the Subaru Telescope, which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, and with the NASA/ESA HST, obtained at STScI, which is operated by AURA, under NASA contract NAS5-26555.},

The discovery space of this band is potentially rich with populations of inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries, decaying cosmic string networks, relic post-inflation GWs, and even non-GW imprints of axionic dark matter. This article aims to provide an understanding of the exciting open science questions in cosmology, galaxy evolution, and fundamental physics that will be addressed by the detection and study of GWs through PTAs. The focus of the article is on providing an understanding of the mechanisms by which PTAs can address specific questions in these fields, and to outline some of the subtleties and difficulties in each case. The material included is weighted most heavily toward the questions which we expect will be answered in the near-term with PTAs; however, we have made efforts to include most currently anticipated applications of nanohertz GWs.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the mass spectrum of primordial black holes that should result if the early universe consisted of small density fluctuations superposed on a Friedmann background. It is shown that only a certain type of fluctuation favors the formation of primordial black holes and that, consequently, their spectrum should always have a particular form. Since both the fluctuations which arise naturally and the fluctuations which are often invoked to explain galaxy formation are of the required type, primordial black holes could have had an important effect on the evolution of the universe. Although primordial black holes are unlikely to have a critical density, big ones could have been sufficiently numerous to act as condensation nuclei for galaxies. Observational limits on the spectrum of primordial black holes place strong constraints on the magnitude of density fluctuations in the early universe and support the assumption that the early universe was nearly Friedmann rather than chaotic. Any model in which the early universe has a soft equation of state for a prolonged period is shown to be suspect, since primordial black holes probably form too prolifically in such a situation to be consistent with observation.},

We exploit our parametrization to tackle the problem of astrophysical inference from pulsar timing array (PTA) observations. We simulate a series of upper limits and detections and use a nested sampling algorithm to explore the parameter space. Corroborating previous results, we find that the current PTA non-detection does not place significant constraints on any observables; however, either future upper limits or detections will significantly enhance our knowledge of the SMBHB population. If a GWB is not detected at a level of hc(f = 1 yr-1) = 10-17, our current understanding of galaxy and SMBHB mergers is disfavoured at a 5{$\sigma$} level, indicating a combination of severe binary stalling, overestimating of the SMBH-host galaxy relations, and extreme dynamical properties of merging SMBHBs. Conversely, future detections of a Square Kilometre Array (SKA)-type instrument will allow to constrain the normalization of the SMBHB merger rate in the Universe, the time between galaxy pairing and SMBHB merging, the normalization of the SMBH-host galaxy relations and the dynamical binary properties, including their eccentricity and density of stellar environment.},

We employ a physically motivated model that connects the GWB spectrum to a series of parameters describing the underlying redshift evolution of the MBHB mass function and to the typical eccentricity they acquire while interacting with the dense environment of post-merger galactic nuclei. This allows the folding in of information about the spectral shape of the GWB into the analysis. The priors on the model parameters are assumed to be uninformative and consistent with the current lack of secure observations of sub-parsec MBHBs. We explore the implications of current upper limits and of future detections with a variety of PTA configurations. We confirm our previous finding that current upper limits can only place an upper bound on the overall MBHB merger rate. Depending on the properties of the array, future detections can also constrain several MBHB population models at different degrees of fidelity. In particular, a simultaneous detection of a steepening of the spectrum at high frequency and a bending at low frequency will place strong constraints on both the MBHB mass function and on the typical eccentricity of inspiralling MBHBs, providing insights into MBHB astrophysics unlikely to be achievable by any other means.},

Radiative heating is a key factor in the self-regulated coevolution of massive BHs and their host galaxies, and (1) the mass accumulated by the central BH is limited by feedback to the range observed today and (2) relaxation instabilities occur so that duty cycles are small enough ({$<\sptilde$}0.03) to account for the very small fraction of massive ellipticals observed to be in the ``on'' QSO phase, when the accretion luminosity approaches the Eddington luminosity. The duty cycle of the hot bubbles inflated at the galactic center during major accretion episodes is of the order of {$>\sptilde$}0.1-0.4. Major accretion episodes caused by cooling flows in the recycled gas produced by normal stellar evolution trigger nuclear starbursts coincident with AGN flaring. Overall, in the bursting phase (1{$<\sptilde$}z{$<\sptilde$}3), the duty cycle of the BH in its ``on'' phase is of the order of percents and is unobscured approximately one-third of the time, the obscuration occurring during dusty starbursts. Roughly half of the recycled gas from dying stars is ejected as galactic winds, half is consumed in central starbursts, and less than 1\% is accreted onto the central BH. Mechanical energy output from nonrelativistic gas winds integrates to 2.3\texttimes 1059 ergs, with most of it caused by broad-line AGN outflows. We predict the typical properties of the very metal-rich poststarburst central regions and show that the resulting surface density profiles are well described by S\'ersic profiles.},

The singlet makes the phase transition strongly first-order through its coupling to the Higgs boson, and it spontaneously breaks CP invariance through a dimension-5 contribution to the top quark mass term, generated by integrating out the heavy top quark partners. We improve on previous studies by incorporating updated transport equations, compatible with large bubble wall velocities \$v\_w\$, to determine the friction on the wall, and thereby \$v\_w\$ and the wall thickness, rather than treating these as free parameters. The baryon asymmetry is also computed with no assumptions, directly from the microphysical parameters. The size of the CP-violating dimension-5 operator is constrained by collider, electroweak precision, and renormalization group running constraints. We identify regions of parameter space that can produce the observed baryon asymmetry, and simultaneously produce gravitational waves that could be observed by future experiments. Contrary to standard lore, we find that for strong deflagrations, the efficiencies of large baryon asymmetry production and strong GW-signal can be positively correlated.},

Consequently, double-peaked narrow AGN emission lines are useful tracers of the coevolution of galaxies and their supermassive black holes, as driven by AGN feedback and AGN fueling. We investigate this concept further with follow-up optical longslit observations of a sample of 95 Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies that have double-peaked narrow AGN emission lines. Based on a kinematic analysis of the longslit spectra, we confirm previous work that finds that the majority of double-peaked narrow AGN emission lines are associated with outflows. We also find that eight of the galaxies have companion galaxies with line-of-sight velocity separations {$<$}500 km s-1 and physical separations {$<$}30 kpc. Since we find evidence of AGNs in both galaxies, all eight of these systems are compelling dual AGN candidates. Galaxies with double-peaked narrow AGN emission lines occur in such galaxy mergers at least twice as often as typical active galaxies. Finally, we conclude that at least 3\% of SDSS galaxies with double-peaked narrow AGN emission lines are found in galaxy mergers where both galaxies are resolved in SDSS imaging.},

We present methods for analyzing post-fit timing residuals for the presence of a gravitational wave signal with a specified spectral shape. These optimally take into account the timing fluctuation power removed by the model fit, and can be applied to either data from a single pulsar, or to a set of pulsars to detect a correlated signal. We apply these methods to our data set to set an upper limit on the strength of the nHz-frequency stochastic supermassive black hole gravitational wave background of hc(1 yr-1) {$<$} 7 \texttimes{} 10-15 (95\%).

  abstract = {Context: The rate at which galaxies grow via successive mergers is a key  element in understanding the main phases of galaxy evolution. Aims: We measure the evolution of the fraction of galaxies in pairs and the merging rate since redshift z 1 assuming a (H0 = 70 km s-1 Mpc-1, {$\Omega$}M = 0.3 and {$\Omega\Lambda$} = 0.7) cosmology. Methods: From the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey we use a sample of 6464 galaxies with I\_AB {$\leq$} 24 to identify 314 pairs of galaxies, each member with a secure spectroscopic redshift, which are close in both projected separation and in velocity. Results: We estimate that at z 0.9, 10.9 {$\pm$} 3.2\% of galaxies with MB(z) {$\leq$} -18-Qz (Q = 1.11) are in pairs with separations {$\Delta$} rp {$\leq$} 20 h-1 kpc, {$\Delta$} v{$\leq$} 500 km s-1, and with {$\Delta$} MB {$\leq$} 1.5, significantly larger than 3.8 {$\pm$} 1.7\% at z 0.5; thus, the pair fraction evolves as (1 + z)m with m = 4.73 {$\pm$} 2.01. For bright galaxies with MB(z = 0) {$\leq$} -18.77, the pair fraction is higher and its evolution with redshift is flatter with m = 1.50 {$\pm$} 0.76, a property also observed for galaxies with increasing stellar masses. Early-type pairs (dry mergers) increase their relative fraction from 3\% at z 0.9 to 12\% at z 0.5. The star formation rate traced by the rest-frame [OII] EW increases by 26 {$\pm$} 4\% for pairs with the smallest separation rp {$\leq$} 20 h-1 kpc. Following published prescriptions to derive merger timescales, we find that the merger rate of MB(z) {$\leq$} -18-Qz galaxies evolves as N\_mg = (4.96 {$\pm$} 2.07)\texttimes 10-4\texttimes (1 + z)2.20 {$\pm$} 0.77 mergers Mpc-3 Gyr-1. Conclusions: The merger rate of galaxies with MB(z) {$\leq$} -18-Qz has significantly evolved since z 1 and is strongly dependent on the luminosity or stellar mass of galaxies. The major merger rate increases more rapidly with redshift for galaxies with fainter luminosities or stellar mass, while the evolution of the merger rate for bright or massive galaxies is slower, indicating that the slow evolution reported for the brightest galaxies is not universal. The merger rate is also strongly dependent on the spectral type of galaxies involved. Late-type mergers were more frequent in the past, while early-type mergers are more frequent today, contributing to the rise in the local density of early-type galaxies. About 20\% of the stellar mass in present day galaxies with log(M/M\{{$\odot\rbrace$}) {$\geq$} 9.5 has been accreted through major merging events since z = 1. This indicates that major mergers have contributed significantly to the growth in stellar mass density of bright galaxies over the last half of the life of the Universe. based on observations obtained with the European Southern Observatory Telescopes at the Paranal Observatory, under programs 072.A-0586 and 073.A-0647.\vphantom\}},

The binary black hole (BBH) central engine model, proposed by Lehto and Valtonen in 1996, was influenced by the two distinct periodicities inferred from the optical light curve of OJ 287. The current improved model employs an accurate general relativistic description to track the trajectory of the secondary black hole (BH) which is crucial to predict the inherent impact flares of OJ 287. The successful observations of three predicted impact flares open up the possibility of using this BBH system to test general relativity in a hitherto unexplored strong field regime.

  abstract = {We present a new analysis of stellar mass functions in the COSMOS field  to fainter limits than has been previously probed at z {$<$}= 1. The increase in dynamic range reveals features in the shape of the stellar mass function that deviate from a single Schechter function. Neither the total nor the red (passive) or blue (star-forming) galaxy stellar mass functions can be well fitted with a single Schechter function once the mass completeness limit of the sample probes below \textasciitilde 3 \texttimes{} 109 M sun. We observe a dip or plateau at masses \textasciitilde 1010 M sun, just below the traditional M*, and an upturn toward a steep faint-end slope of {$\alpha$} \textasciitilde{} -1.7 at lower mass at all redshifts {$<$}=1. This bimodal nature of the mass function is not solely a result of the blue/red dichotomy. Indeed, the blue mass function is by itself bimodal at z \textasciitilde{} 1. This suggests a new dichotomy in galaxy formation that predates the appearance of the red sequence. We propose two interpretations for this bimodal distribution. If the gas fraction increases toward lower mass, galaxies with M baryon \textasciitilde{} 1010 M sun would shift to lower stellar masses, creating the observed dip. This would indicate a change in star formation efficiency, perhaps linked to supernovae feedback becoming much more efficient below \textasciitilde 1010 M sun. Therefore, we investigate whether the dip is present in the baryonic (stars+gas) mass function. Alternatively, the dip could be created by an enhancement of the galaxy assembly rate at \textasciitilde 1011 M sun, a phenomenon that naturally arises if the baryon fraction peaks at M halo \textasciitilde{} 1012 M sun. In this scenario, galaxies occupying the bump around M * would be identified with central galaxies and the second fainter component of the mass function having a steep faint-end slope with satellite galaxies. The low-mass end of the blue and total mass functions exhibit a steeper slope than has been detected in previous work that may increasingly approach the halo mass function value of -2. While the dip feature is apparent in the total mass function at all redshifts, it appears to shift from the blue to the red population, likely as a result of transforming high-mass blue galaxies into red ones. At the same time, we detect a drastic upturn in the number of low-mass red galaxies.

  abstract = {We have developed the ``SIX'' statistic to identify bright, highly likely active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidates solely on the basis of Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS), and ROSAT all-sky survey (RASS) data. This statistic was optimized with data from the preliminary WISE survey and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and tested with Lick 3 m Kast spectroscopy. We find that sources with SIX {$<$} 0 have a {$\greaterequivlnt$}95\% likelihood of being an AGN (defined in this paper as a Seyfert 1, quasar, or blazar). This statistic was then applied to the full WISE/2MASS/RASS dataset, including the final WISE data release, to yield the ``W2R'' sample of 4316 sources with SIX {$<$} 0. Only 2209 of these sources are currently in the Veron\textendash Cetty and Veron (VCV) catalog of spectroscopically confirmed AGNs, indicating that the W2R sample contains nearly 2000 new, relatively bright (J {$\lessequivlnt$} 16) AGNs. We utilize the W2R sample to quantify biases and incompleteness in the VCV catalog. We find that it is highly complete for bright (J {$<$} 14), northern AGNs, but the completeness drops below 50\% for fainter, southern samples and for sources near the Galactic plane. This approach also led to the spectroscopic identification of 10 new AGNs in the Kepler field, more than doubling the number of AGNs being monitored by Kepler. The W2R sample contains better than 1 bright AGN every 10 deg2, permitting construction of AGN samples in any sufficiently large region of sky.},

Each candidate was originally identified via double-peaked [O III] {$\lambda$}5007 emission lines and received follow-up Chandra and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations. Because the X-ray data are low-count ({$<$}100 counts) with small separations ({$<$}1{${''}$}), a robust analysis is necessary for classifying each source. Pairing long-slit [O III] observations with existing Chandra observations, we re-analyze the X-ray observations with Bayesian AnalYsis of AGNs in X-rays to determine whether the X-ray emission from each system is more likely a single or dual point source. We find that 4 of the 12 sources are likely dual X-ray point-source systems. We examine each point source's spectra via a Monte Carlo method that probabilistically identifies the likely origin of each photon. When doing so, we find that (I) the secondary X-ray point sources in two of the systems have LX {$<$} 1040 erg s-1, such that we cannot rule out a non-AGN origin, (II) one source has a secondary with LX {$>$} 1040 erg s-1 but a spectrum that is too soft to definitively preclude being X-ray emitting diffuse gas that was photoionized by the primary AGN, and (III) one system (SDSS J1126+2944) is a dual AGN. Additionally, using complementary HST observations, we analyze a subsample of systems that are visually identified as merging. Our results suggest that dual AGNs may preferentially reside in mergers with small separations, consistent with both simulations and observations.},

We currently lack firm empirical constraints on the amplitude of the GWB due to the dearth of confirmed SMBH binaries in the required mass range. Using Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3 images, we have discovered a z \texttildelow{} 0.2 quasar hosted in a merger remnant with two closely separated (0.{${''}$}13 or \texttildelow 430 pc) continuum cores at the heart of the galaxy SDSS J1010+1413.

  abstract = {We present a physically motivated model for the early coevolution of massive spheroidal galaxies and active nuclei at their centers. Within dark matter halos, forming at the rate predicted by the canonical hierarchical clustering scenario, the gas evolution is controlled by gravity, radiative cooling, and heating by feedback from supernovae and from the growing active nucleus. Supernova heating is increasingly effective with decreasing binding energy in slowing down the star formation and in driving gas outflows. The more massive protogalaxies virializing at earlier times are thus the sites of the faster star formation. The correspondingly higher radiation drag fastens the angular momentum loss by the gas, resulting in a larger accretion rate onto the central black hole. In turn, the kinetic energy carried by outflows driven by active nuclei can unbind the residual gas, thus halting both the star formation and the black hole growth, in a time again shorter for larger halos. For the most massive galaxies the gas unbinding time is short enough for the bulk of the star formation to be completed before Type Ia supernovae can substantially increase the Fe abundance of the interstellar medium, thus accounting for the {$\alpha$}-enhancement seen in the largest galaxies. The feedback from supernovae and from the active nucleus also determines the relationship between the black hole mass and the mass, or the velocity dispersion, of the host galaxy, as well as the black hole mass function. In both cases the model predictions are in excellent agreement with the observational data. Coupling the model with GRASIL (Silva et al. 1998), the code computing in a self-consistent way the chemical and spectrophotometric evolution of galaxies over a very wide wavelength interval, we have obtained predictions in excellent agreement with observations for a number of observables that proved to be extremely challenging for all the current semianalytic models, including the submillimeter counts and the corresponding redshift distributions, and the epoch-dependent K-band luminosity function of spheroidal galaxies.},

  abstract = {We summarize what large surveys of the contemporary Universe have taught us about the physics and phenomenology of the processes that link the formation and evolution of galaxies with their central supermassive black holes. We present a picture in which the population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can be divided into two distinct populations. The radiative-mode AGNs are associated with black holes (BHs) that produce radiant energy powered by accretion at rates in excess of {$\sim$}1\% of the Eddington limit. They are primarily associated with less massive BHs growing in high-density pseudobulges at a rate sufficient to produce the total mass budget in these BHs in {$\sim$}10 Gyr. The circumnuclear environment contains high-density cold gas and associated star formation. Major mergers are not the primary mechanism for transporting this gas inward; secular processes appear dominant. Stellar feedback is generic in these objects, and strong AGN feedback is seen only in the most powerful AGNs. In jet-mode AGNs the bulk of energetic output takes the form of collimated outflows (jets). These AGNs are associated with the more massive BHs in more massive (classical) bulges and elliptical galaxies. Neither the accretion onto these BHs nor star formation in their host bulge is significant today. These AGNs are probably fueled by the accretion of slowly cooling hot gas that is limited by the feedback/heating provided by AGN radio sources. Surveys of the high-redshift Universe paint a similar picture. Noting that the volume-averaged ratio of star formation to BH growth has remained broadly constant over the past 10 Gyrs, we argue that the processes that linked the cosmic evolution of galaxies and BHs are still at play today.},

Quasi-periodic variability on year-like time-scales has been detected in a number of bright sources, and has been connected to the orbital motion of a putative massive black hole binary. If this were indeed the case, those blazar binaries would contribute to the nanohertz gravitational-wave stochastic background. We test the binary hypothesis for the blazar population observed by the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope, which consists of BL Lacertae objects and flat-spectrum radio quasars. Using mock populations informed by the luminosity functions for BL Lacertae objects and flat-spectrum radio quasars with redshifts z {$\leq$} 2, we calculate the expected gravitational-wave background and compare it to recent pulsar timing array upper limits. The two are consistent only if a fraction {$\lessequivlnt$}10-3 of blazars hosts a binary with orbital periods {$<$}5 yr. We therefore conclude that binarity cannot significantly explain year-like quasi-periodicity in blazars.},

  abstract = {We develop a model for the cosmological role of mergers in the evolution  of starbursts, quasars, and spheroidal galaxies. By combining theoretically well-constrained halo and subhalo mass functions as a function of redshift and environment with empirical halo occupation models, we can estimate where galaxies of given properties live at a particular epoch. This allows us to calculate, in an a priori cosmological manner, where major galaxy-galaxy mergers occur and what kinds of galaxies merge, at all redshifts. We compare this with the observed mass functions, clustering, fractions as a function of halo and galaxy mass, and small-scale environments of mergers, and we show that this approach yields robust estimates in good agreement with observations and can be extended to predict detailed properties of mergers. Making the simple Ansatz that major, gas-rich mergers cause quasar activity (but not strictly assuming they are the only triggering mechanism), we demonstrate that this model naturally reproduces the observed rise and fall of the quasar luminosity density at z = 0-6, as well as quasar luminosity functions, fractions, host galaxy colors, and clustering as a function of redshift and luminosity. The recent observed excess of quasar clustering on small scales at z \textasciitilde{} 0.2-2.5 is a natural prediction of our model, as mergers will preferentially occur in regions with excess small-scale galaxy overdensities. In fact, we demonstrate that quasar environments at all observed redshifts correspond closely to the empirically determined small group scale, where major mergers of \textasciitilde L* gas-rich galaxies will be most efficient. We contrast this with a secular model in which quasar activity is driven by bars or other disk instabilities, and we show that, while these modes of fueling probably dominate the high Eddington ratio population at Seyfert luminosities (significant at z = 0), the constraints from quasar clustering, observed pseudobulge populations, and disk mass functions suggest that they are a small contributor to the z gtrsim 1 quasar luminosity density, which is dominated by massive BHs in predominantly classical spheroids formed in mergers. Similarly, low-luminosity Seyferts do not show a clustering excess on small scales, in agreement with the natural prediction of secular models, but bright quasars at all redshifts do so. We also compare recent observations of the colors of quasar host galaxies and show that these correspond to the colors of recent merger remnants, in the transition region between the blue cloud and the red sequence, and are distinct from the colors of systems with observed bars or strong disk instabilities. Even the most extreme secular models, in which all bulge (and therefore BH) formation proceeds via disk instability, are forced to assume that this instability acts before the (dynamically inevitable) mergers, and therefore predict a history for the quasar luminosity density that is shifted to earlier times, in disagreement with observations. Our model provides a powerful means to predict the abundance and nature of mergers and to contrast cosmologically motivated predictions of merger products such as starbursts and active galactic nuclei.},

Accounting for the observed distributions of quasar column densities and variation of SED shapes, as well as their dependence on luminosity, makes it possible to integrate the observations in a reliable manner and provides a baseline in redshift and luminosity larger than that of any individual survey. We infer the QLF break luminosity and faint-end slope out to z\textasciitilde 4.5 and confirm at high significance ({$>\sptilde$}10 {$\sigma$}) previous claims of a flattening in both the faint- and bright-end slopes with redshift. With the best-fit estimates of the column density distribution and quasar SED, which both depend on luminosity, a single bolometric QLF self-consistently reproduces the observed QLFs in all bands and at all redshifts for which we compile measurements. Ignoring this luminosity dependence does not yield a self-consistent bolometric QLF and there is no evidence for any additional dependence on redshift. We calculate the expected relic black hole mass function and mass density, cosmic X-ray background, and ionization rate as a function of redshift and find that they are consistent with existing measurements. The peak in the total quasar luminosity density is well constrained at z=2.15+/-0.05.

The quasar lifetime and obscuring column density depend on both the instantaneous and peak quasar luminosity, and we determine this dependence using a large set of galaxy merger simulations varying galaxy properties, orbital geometry, and gas physics. We use these fits to deconvolve observed quasar luminosity functions and obtain the evolution of the formation rate of quasars with peak luminosity, n dot(Lpeak,z). Quasars spend extended periods at luminosities well below peak, so n dot(Lpeak) has a maximum corresponding to the ``break'' in the observed luminosity function. From n dot(Lpeak) and our simulations, we obtain self-consistent hard and soft X-ray and optical luminosity functions and predict many observables at multiple redshifts, including column density distributions of optical and X-ray samples, the luminosity function of broad-line quasars in X-ray samples and broad-line fraction versus luminosity, active BH mass functions, the distribution of Eddington ratios, the mass function of relic BHs and total BH mass density, and the cosmic X-ray background.

  abstract = {We follow the galaxy stellar mass assembly by morphological and spectral type in the COSMOS 2 deg2 field. We derive the stellar mass functions and stellar mass densities from z = 2 to z = 0.2 using 196,000 galaxies selected at F 3.6 {$\mu$}m {$>$} 1 {$\mu$}Jy with accurate photometric redshifts ({$\sigma\_\lbrace$}(z\_phot-z\_spec)/(1+z\_spec)\vphantom\{\}=0.008 at i + {$<$} 22.5). Using a spectral classification, we find that z \textasciitilde{} 1 is an epoch of transition in the stellar mass assembly of quiescent galaxies. Their stellar mass density increases by 1.1 dex between z = 1.5-2 and z = 0.8-1 ({$\Delta$}t \textasciitilde{} 2.5 Gyr), but only by 0.3 dex between z = 0.8-1 and z \textasciitilde{} 0.1 ({$\Delta$}t \textasciitilde{} 6 Gyr). Then, we add the morphological information and find that 80\%-90\% of the massive quiescent galaxies (log M {$\sim$} 11) have an elliptical morphology at z {$<$} 0.8. Therefore, a dominant mechanism links the shutdown of star formation and the acquisition of an elliptical morphology in massive galaxies. Still, a significant fraction of quiescent galaxies present a Spi/Irr morphology at low mass (40\%-60\% at log M{$\sim$} 9.5), but this fraction is smaller than predicted by semi-analytical models using a "halo quenching" recipe. We also analyze the evolution of star-forming galaxies and split them into "intermediate activity" and "high activity" galaxies. We find that the most massive "high activity" galaxies end their high star formation rate phase first. Finally, the space density of massive star-forming galaxies becomes lower than the space density of massive elliptical galaxies at z {$<$} 1. As a consequence, the rate of "wet mergers" involved in the formation of the most massive ellipticals must decline very rapidly at z {$<$} 1, which could explain the observed slow down in the assembly of these quiescent and massive sources.

  abstract = {We have performed a spectral decomposition to search for dual active galactic nuclei (DAGNs) in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasars with \$z{$<$}0.25\$. Potential DAGN candidates are searched by referencing velocity offsets and spectral shapes of double-peaked [O III] lines of known DAGNs. Out of 1271 SDSS quasars, we have identified 77 DAGN candidates. Optical and mid-infrared diagnostic diagrams are used to investigate the ionizing source in the DAGN candidates. The optical diagnostic analysis suggests 93\textbackslash\% of them are powered by AGNs, and mid-infrared diagnostic analysis suggests 97\textbackslash\% are powered by AGNs. About 1/3 of the SDSS images of the DAGN candidates show signs of tidal interaction, but we are unable to identify double nuclei in most of them due to the low spatial resolution of the archival imaging data available for most of the sample. The radio-loud fraction of the DAGN candidates (\$\textbackslash sim\$10\textbackslash\%) is similar to that of typical AGNs.},

  abstract = {Estimates of galaxy merger rates based on counts of close pairs  typically assume that most of the observed systems will merge within a few hundred Myr (for projected pair separations {$<$}=25h-1kpc). Here we investigate these assumptions using virtual galaxy catalogues derived from the Millennium Simulation, a very large N-body simulation of structure formation in the concordance {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) cosmology. These catalogues have been shown to be at least roughly consistent with a wide range of properties of the observed galaxy population at both low and high redshift. Here we show that they also predict close pair abundances at low redshift which agree with those observed. They thus embed a realistic and realistically evolving galaxy population within the standard structure formation paradigm, and so are well suited to calibrate the relation between close galaxy pairs and mergers. We show that observational methods, when applied to our mock galaxy surveys, do indeed identify pairs which are physically close and due to merge. The sample-averaged merging time depends only weakly on the stellar mass and redshift of the pair. At z {$<$}= 2 this time-scale is T \textasciitilde{} T0r25 M-0.3*, where r25 is the maximum projected separation of the pair sample in units of 25h-1kpc, M* is the typical stellar mass of the pairs in units of 3 \texttimes{} 1010h-1Msolar and the coefficient T0 is 1.1Gyr for samples selected to have line-of-sight velocity difference smaller than 300kms-1 and 1.6Gyr for samples where this velocity difference is effectively unconstrained. These time-scales increase slightly with redshift and are longer than assumed in most observational studies, implying that merger rates have typically been overestimated.},

  abstract = {Supermassive black holes (BHs) have been found in 85 galaxies by dynamical modeling of spatially resolved kinematics. The Hubble Space Telescope revolutionized BH research by advancing the subject from its proof-of-concept phase into quantitative studies of BH demographics. Most influential was the discovery of a tight correlation between BH mass [Formula: see text] and the velocity dispersion {$\sigma$} of the bulge component of the host galaxy. Together with similar correlations with bulge luminosity and mass, this led to the widespread belief that BHs and bulges coevolve by regulating each other's growth. Conclusions based on one set of correlations from [Formula: see text] in brightest cluster ellipticals to [Formula: see text] in the smallest galaxies dominated BH work for more than a decade. New results are now replacing this simple story with a richer and more plausible picture in which BHs correlate differently with different galaxy components. A reasonable aim is to use this progress to refine our understanding of BH-galaxy coevolution. BHs with masses of 105-106M{$\odot$} are found in many bulgeless galaxies. Therefore, classical (elliptical-galaxy-like) bulges are not necessary for BH formation. On the other hand, although they live in galaxy disks, BHs do not correlate with galaxy disks. Also, any [Formula: see text] correlations with the properties of disk-grown pseudobulges and dark matter halos are weak enough to imply no close coevolution. The above and other correlations of host-galaxy parameters with each other and with [Formula: see text] suggest that there are four regimes of BH feedback. (1) Local, secular, episodic, and stochastic feeding of small BHs in largely bulgeless galaxies involves too little energy to result in coevolution. (2) Global feeding in major, wet galaxy mergers rapidly grows giant BHs in short-duration, quasar-like events whose energy feedback does affect galaxy evolution. The resulting hosts are classical bulges and coreless-rotating-disky ellipticals. (3) After these AGN phases and at the highest galaxy masses, maintenance-mode BH feedback into X-ray-emitting gas has the primarily negative effect of helping to keep baryons locked up in hot gas and thereby keeping galaxy formation from going to completion. This happens in giant, core-nonrotating-boxy ellipticals. Their properties, including their tight correlations between [Formula: see text] and core parameters, support the conclusion that core ellipticals form by dissipationless major mergers. They inherit coevolution effects from smaller progenitor galaxies. Also, (4) independent of any feedback physics, in BH growth modes 2 and 3, the averaging that results from successive mergers plays a major role in decreasing the scatter in [Formula: see text] correlations from the large values observed in bulgeless and pseudobulge galaxies to the small values observed in giant elliptical galaxies.},

For adiabatic perturbations, the fluctuations in GWB follow those in the CMB, but if primordial fluctuations carry an isocurvature component, this need no longer be true. It is shown that in non-minimal inflationary and reheating settings, primordial isocurvature can survive in GWB and exhibit significant non-Gaussianity (NG) in contrast to the CMB, while obeying current observational bounds. While probing such NG GWB is at best a marginal possibility at LISA, there is much greater scope at future proposed detectors such as DECIGO and BBO. It is even possible that the first observations of inflation-era NG could be made with gravitational wave detectors as opposed to the CMB or Large-Scale Structure surveys.},

  abstract = {Recently, an indicative evidence of a stochastic process, reported by the NANOGrav Collaboration based on the analysis of 12.5-year pulsar timing array data which might be interpreted as a potential stochastic gravitational wave signal, has aroused keen interest of theorists. The first-order cosmological confinement/deconfinement phase transition at the QCD scale could be one of the cosmological sources for the NANOGrav signal. If the phase transition is flavor dependent and happens sequentially, it is important to find the dominant phase transition producing the gravitational waves that match the NANOGrav signal during the evolution of the universe. In this paper, we would like to illustrate that the NANOGrav signal could be generated from confinement/deconfinement transition in either heavy static quarks with a zero baryon chemical potential, or quarks with a finite baryon chemical potential, or a pure gluon system. Moreover, the quark confinement as compared with the gluon confinement is more likely to be the source for the NANOGrav signal regardless of whether the chemical potential is finite or not. Future observation will help to distinguish between different scenarios.},

  abstract = {Aims: The role of galaxy mergers in massive galaxy evolution, and  in particular to mass assembly and size growth, remains an open question. In this paper we measure the merger fraction and rate, both minor and major, of massive early-type galaxies (M {$\star$}  {$\geq$} 1011 M{$\odot$}) in the COSMOS field, and study their role in mass and size evolution. Methods: We used the 30-band photometric catalogue in COSMOS, complemented with the spectroscopy of the zCOSMOS survey, to define close pairs with a separation on the sky plane 10 h-1 kpc {$\leq$} rp {$\leq$} 30 h-1 kpc and a relative velocity {$\Delta$}v {$\leq$} 500 km s-1 in redshift space. We measured both major (stellar mass ratio {$\mu$} {$\equiv$} M {$\star$} ,2/M {$\star$} ,1 {$\geq$} 1/4) and minor (1/10 {$\leq$} {$\mu$} {$<$} 1/4) merger fractions of massive galaxies, and studied their dependence on redshift and on morphology (early types vs. late types). Results: The merger fraction and rate of massive galaxies evolves as a power-law (1 + z)n, with major mergers increasing with redshift, nMM = 1.4, and minor mergers showing little evolution, nmm \textasciitilde{} 0. When split by their morphology, the minor merger fraction for early-type galaxies (ETGs) is higher by a factor of three than that for late-type galaxies (LTGs), and both are nearly constant with redshift. The fraction of major mergers for massive LTGs evolves faster (nMMLT \textasciitilde{} 4 ) than for ETGs (nMMET= 1.8). Conclusions: Our results show that massive ETGs have undergone 0.89 mergers (0.43 major and 0.46 minor) since z \textasciitilde{} 1, leading to a mass growth of \textasciitilde 30\%. We find that {$\mu$} {$\geq$} 1/10 mergers can explain \textasciitilde 55\% of the observed size evolution of these galaxies since z \textasciitilde{} 1. Another \textasciitilde 20\% is due to the progenitor bias (younger galaxies are more extended) and we estimate that very minor mergers ({$\mu$} {$<$} 1/10) could contribute with an extra \textasciitilde 20\%. The remaining \textasciitilde 5\% should come from other processes (e.g., adiabatic expansion or observational effects). This picture also reproduces the mass growth and the velocity dispersion evolution of these galaxies. We conclude from these results, and after exploring all the possible uncertainties in our picture, that merging is the main contributor to the size evolution of massive ETGs at z {$\lessequivlnt$} 1, accounting for \textasciitilde 50-75\% of that evolution in the last 8 Gyr. Nearly half of the evolution due to mergers is related to minor ({$\mu$} {$<$} 1/4) events.

  abstract = {The majority of galaxy mergers are expected to be minor mergers. The  observational signatures of minor mergers are not well understood; thus, there exist few constraints on the minor merger rate. This paper seeks to address this gap in our understanding by determining if and when minor mergers exhibit disturbed morphologies and how they differ from the morphology of major mergers. We simulate a series of unequal-mass moderate gas-fraction disc galaxy mergers. With the resulting g-band images, we determine how the time-scale for identifying galaxy mergers via projected separation and quantitative morphology (the Gini coefficient G, asymmetry A and the second-order moment of the brightest 20 per cent of the light M20) depends on the merger mass ratio, relative orientations and orbital parameters. We find that G-M20 is as sensitive to 9:1 baryonic mass ratio mergers as 1:1 mergers, with observability time-scales of \textasciitilde 0.2-0.4Gyr. In contrast, asymmetry finds mergers with baryonic mass ratios between 4:1 and 1:1 (assuming local disc galaxy gas fractions). Asymmetry time-scales for moderate gas-fraction major disc mergers are \textasciitilde 0.2-0.4Gyr and less than 0.06Gyr for moderate gas-fraction minor mergers. The relative orientations and orbits have little effect on the time-scales for morphological disturbances. Observational studies of close pairs often select major mergers by choosing paired galaxies with similar luminosities and/or stellar masses. Therefore, the various ways of finding galaxy mergers (G-M20, A, close pairs) are sensitive to galaxy mergers of different mass ratios. By comparing the frequency of mergers selected by different techniques, one may place empirical constraints on the major and minor galaxy merger rates.},

  abstract = {We quantify the importance of mass accretion during AGN phases in the growth of supermassive black holes (BH) by comparing the mass function of black holes in the local universe with that expected from AGN relics, which are black holes grown entirely with mass accretion during AGN phases. The local BH mass function (BHMF) is estimated by applying the well-known correlations between BH mass, bulge luminosity and stellar velocity dispersion to galaxy luminosity and velocity functions. The density of BH's in the local universe is 4.6 (-1.4; +1.9) (h/0.7)\^2 10\^5 Msun Mpc\^-3. The relic BHMF is derived from the continuity equation with the only assumption that AGN activity is due to accretion onto massive BH's and that merging is not important. We find that the relic BHMF at z=0 is generated mainly at z{$<$}3. Moreover, the BH growth is anti-hierarchical in the sense that smaller BH's (MBH{$<$} 10\^7 Msun) grow at lower redshifts (z{$<$}1) with respect to more massive one's (z\textasciitilde 1-3). Unlike previous work, we find that the BHMF of AGN relics is perfectly consistent with the local BHMF indicating the local BH's were mainly grown during AGN activity. This agreement is obtained while satisfying, at the same time, the constraints imposed from the X-ray background. The comparison with the local BHMF also suggests that the merging process is not important in shaping the relic BHMF, at least at low redshifts (z{$<$}3). Our analysis thus suggests the following scenario: local black holes grew during AGN phases in which accreting matter was converted into radiation with efficiencies epsilon = 0.04-0.16 and emitted at a fraction lambda = 0.1-1.7 of the Eddington luminosity. The average total lifetime of these active phases ranges from \textasciitilde 4.5 10\^8 yr for MBH{$<$} 10\^8 Msun to \textasciitilde 1.5 10\^8 yr for MBH{$>$} 10\^9 Msun. (abridged)},

Indeed, while we find an acceptable agreement between the model bolometric LF and the data at 1 {$<\sptilde$} z {$<$}= 2 and for luminosities larger then 1010L bol,solar, no semi-analytic model is capable of reproducing the number density of faint X-ray sources in the local universe. Some improvement can be obtained by advocating energy feedback that we model through a time-dependent Eddington ratio. Even in this case, however, the number density of faint AGNs is significantly below observations. This failure indicates that major mergers cannot constitute the only trigger to accretion episodes in the local AGN population.},

  abstract = {New kinematic data and modeling efforts in the past few years have substantially expanded and revised dynamical measurements of black hole masses (M \textsubscript{{$\bullet$}}) at the centers of nearby galaxies. Here we compile an updated sample of 72 black holes and their host galaxies, and present revised scaling relations between M \textsubscript{{$\bullet$}} and stellar velocity dispersion ({$\sigma$}), V-band luminosity (L), and bulge stellar mass (M \textsubscript{bulge}), for different galaxy subsamples. Our best-fitting power-law relations for the full galaxy sample are log\textsubscript{10}(M \textsubscript{{$\bullet$}}) = 8.32 + 5.64log\textsubscript{10}({$\sigma$}/200 km s\textsuperscript{-1}), log\textsubscript{10}(M \textsubscript{{$\bullet$}}) = 9.23 + 1.11log\textsubscript{10}(L/10\textsuperscript{11} L \textsubscript{{$\Sun$}}), and log\textsubscript{10}(M \textsubscript{{$\bullet$}}) = 8.46 + 1.05log\textsubscript{10}(M \textsubscript{bulge}/10\textsuperscript{11} M \textsubscript{{$\Sun$}}). A log-quadratic fit to the M \textsubscript{{$\bullet$}}-{$\sigma$} relation with an additional term of {$\beta$}\textsubscript{2} [log\textsubscript{10}({$\sigma$}/200 km s\textsuperscript{-1})]\textsuperscript{2} gives {$\beta$}\textsubscript{2} = 1.68 {$\pm$} 1.82 and does not decrease the intrinsic scatter in M \textsubscript{{$\bullet$}}. Including 92 additional upper limits on M \textsubscript{{$\bullet$}} does not change the slope of the M \textsubscript{{$\bullet$}}-{$\sigma$} relation. When the early- and late-type galaxies are fit separately, we obtain similar slopes of 5.20 and 5.06 for the M \textsubscript{{$\bullet$}}-{$\sigma$} relation but significantly different intercepts\textemdash M \textsubscript{{$\bullet$}} in early-type galaxies are about two times higher than in late types at a given sigma. Within early-type galaxies, our fits to M \textsubscript{{$\bullet$}}({$\sigma$}) give M \textsubscript{{$\bullet$}} that is about two times higher in galaxies with central core profiles than those with central power-law profiles. Our M \textsubscript{{$\bullet$}}-L and M \textsubscript{{$\bullet$}}-M \textsubscript{bulge} relations for early-type galaxies are similar to those from earlier compilations, and core and power-law galaxies yield similar L- and M \textsubscript{bulge}-based predictions for M \textsubscript{{$\bullet$}}. When the conventional quadrature method is used to determine the intrinsic scatter in M \textsubscript{{$\bullet$}}, our data set shows weak evidence for increased scatter at M \textsubscript{bulge} \&lt; 10\textsuperscript{11} M \textsubscript{{$\Sun$}} or L\textsubscript{V} \&lt; 10\textsuperscript{10.3} L \textsubscript{{$\Sun$}}, while the scatter stays constant for 10\textsuperscript{11} \&lt; M \textsubscript{bulge} \&lt; 10\textsuperscript{12.3} M \textsubscript{{$\Sun$}} and 10\textsuperscript{10.3} \&lt; L\textsubscript{V} \&lt; 10\textsuperscript{11.5} L \textsubscript{{$\Sun$}}. A Bayesian analysis indicates that a larger sample of M \textsubscript{{$\bullet$}} measurements would be needed to detect any statistically significant trend in the scatter with galaxy properties.},

We show that even in the case of a detection resulting from a factor of 10 increase in amplitude sensitivity, PTAs will only put weak constraints on the source merger density as a function of mass, and will not provide any additional information on the redshift distribution. Without additional assumptions or information from other observations, a detection cannot meaningfully bound the massive black hole merger rate above zero for any particular mass.},

  abstract = {The North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) has recently reported evidence for the presence of a common stochastic signal across their array of pulsars. The origin of this signal is still unclear. One of the possibilities is that it is due to a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in the \$\textbackslash sim 1-10\textbackslash,\{\textbackslash rm nHz\}\$ frequency region. Taking the NANOGrav observational result at face value, we show that this signal would be fully consistent with a SGWB produced by an unresolved population of in-spiralling massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) predicted by current theoretical models. Considering an astrophysically agnostic model we find that the MBHB merger rate is loosely constrained to the range \$10\^\{-11\} - 2\$ \$\textbackslash mathrm\{Mpc\}\^\{-3\}\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\{Gyr\}\^\{-1\}\$. Including additional constraints from galaxy pairing fractions and MBH-bulge scaling relations, we find that the MBHB merger rate is \$10\^\{-5\} - 5\textbackslash times10\^\{-4\}\$ \$\textbackslash mathrm\{Mpc\}\^\{-3\}\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\{Gyr\}\^\{-1\}\$, the MBHB merger time-scale is \$\textbackslash le 3\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\{Gyr\}\$ and the norm of the \$M\_\textbackslash mathrm\{BH\}-M\_\textbackslash mathrm\{bulge\}\$ relation \$\textbackslash ge 1.2\textbackslash times 10\^\{8\}\textbackslash,M\_\textbackslash odot\$ (all intervals quoted at 90\textbackslash\% confidence).

Using Bayesian hierarchical modelling we consider implications of this upper limit for a range of astrophysical scenarios, without invoking stalling, nor more exotic physical processes. All scenarios are fully consistent with the upper limit, but (weak) bounds on population parameters can be inferred. Recent upward revisions of the black hole-galaxy bulge mass relation are disfavoured at 1.6{$\sigma$} against lighter models.

There are currently no observations of merging SMBHBs--- it is in fact possible that they stall at their final parsec of separation and never merge. While LIGO has detected high frequency GWs, SMBHBs emit GWs in the nanohertz to millihertz band. This is inaccessible to ground-based interferometers, but possible with Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). Using data from local galaxies in the 2 Micron All-Sky Survey, together with galaxy merger rates from Illustris, we find that there are on average \$91\textbackslash pm7\$ sources emitting GWs in the PTA band, and \$7\textbackslash pm2\$ binaries which will never merge. Local unresolved SMBHBs can contribute to GW background anisotropy at a level of \$\textbackslash sim20\textbackslash\%\$, and if the GW background can be successfully isolated, GWs from at least one local SMBHB can be detected in 10 years.},

The source exhibits a number of X-ray states, in particular both high- and low-luminosity hard states bracketed by extended soft states. Radio flaring is observed shortly after a transition from hard/intermediate states to the soft state. This is broadly in agreement with existing empirical models, but its extended duration hints at multiple unresolved flares and/or jet-ISM interactions. In the hard state radio:X-ray plane, the source is revealed to be 'radio quiet' at high luminosities, but to rejoin the `standard' track at lower luminosities, an increasingly commonly-observed pattern of behaviour.},

  abstract = {Some BL Lacertae objects show a periodic behaviour in their light curves that is often attributed to the orbital motion of a central binary black hole system. On this basis, and assuming a circular orbit, Rieger \& Mannheim ([CITE]) have recently proposed a method to determine the orbital parameters of the binary system from the observed quantities, i.e. the signal periodicity, the flux ratio between maximum and minimum signal and the power law spectral index of the photon flux. However, since these binary black holes are expected to originate from galactic mergers, they could well be on eccentric orbits, which might not circularize for a substantial time. We therefore generalize the treatment proposed by Rieger \& Mannheim ([CITE]) by taking into account the effect of the orbital eccentricity of the binary system. We apply the model to three well-observed Markarian objects: MKN 501, MKN 421 and MKN 766 that most likely host a binary system in their centers. Some astrophysical implications of this model are also investigated with particular emphasis to the gravitational radiation emission from the binary black holes. Under particular conditions (e.g. for some values of the orbital separation, eccentricity and Lorentz factor) one can obtain signals above the sensitivity threshold of the LISA detector.},

Ongoing pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments are aimed at measuring the gravitational-wave (GW) emission from binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centres of galaxy merger remnants. In this paper, using the latest observational estimates for a range of galaxy properties and scaling relations, we predict the amplitude of the GW background generated by the binary SMBH population. We also predict the numbers of individual binary SMBH GW sources. We predict the characteristic strain amplitude of the GW background to lie in the range 5.1~\texttimes ~10-16~\&lt;~Ayr~\&lt;~2.4~\texttimes ~10-15 at a frequency of (1\,yr)-1, with 95\,per\,cent confidence. Higher values within this range, which correspond to the more commonly preferred choice of galaxy merger time-scale, will fall within the expected sensitivity ranges of existing PTA projects in the next few years. In contrast, we find that a PTA consisting of at least 100 pulsars observed with next-generation radio telescopes will be required to detect continuous-wave GWs from binary SMBHs. We further suggest that GW memory bursts from coalescing SMBH pairs are not viable sources for PTAs. Both the GW background and individual GW source counts are dominated by binaries formed in mergers between early-type galaxies of masses~{$\greaterequivlnt$}5~\texttimes ~1010\,M{$\odot$} at redshifts~{$\lessequivlnt$}1.5.

With our new high-resolution VLA observations, we detect compact radio sources toward 39 galaxies and carefully evaluate possible origins for the radio emission, including thermal H II regions, supernova remnants, younger radio supernovae, background interlopers, and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the target galaxies. We find that 13 dwarf galaxies almost certainly host active massive BHs, despite the fact that only one object was previously identified as having optical signatures of an AGN. We also identify a candidate dual radio AGN in a more massive galaxy system. The majority of the radio-detected BHs are offset from the center of the host galaxies, with some systems showing signs of interactions/mergers. Our results indicate that massive BHs need not always live in the nuclei of dwarf galaxies, confirming predictions from simulations. Moreover, searches attempting to constrain BH seed formation using observations of dwarf galaxies need to account for such a population of ``wandering'' BHs.},

It is argued on physical grounds that such close binary systems are likely to give rise to different (although not independent) periodicities in the radio, optical and X-ray/TeV regime, and, hence that detection of appropriate period ratios significantly corroborates the SBBH interpretation. This is illustrated for a binary model where optical longterm periodicity is related to accretion disk interactions, radio periodicity to Newtonian jet precession, and periodicities in the high energy bands to the orbital motion of the jet. We use the observed periodicities to constrain the properties for a sample of SBBH candidates including OJ~287 and AO 0235+16, and discuss the results within the context of jet activity and binary evolution.},

Using the analytic form of this fit we investigate the total stellar mass accreting on to more massive galaxies across all mass ratios. Depending on how conservatively we select our robust merging systems, the fraction of mass merging on to more massive companions is 2.0-5.6 per cent. Using the GAMA-II data we see no significant evidence for a change in the close pair fraction between redshift z = 0.05 and 0.2. However, we find a systematically higher fraction of galaxies in similar mass close pairs compared to published results over a similar redshift baseline. Using a compendium of data and the function {$\gamma$}M = A(1 + z)m to predict the major close pair fraction, we find fitting parameters of A = 0.021 {$\pm$} 0.001 and m = 1.53 {$\pm$} 0.08, which represents a higher low-redshift normalization and shallower power-law slope than recent literature values. We find that the relative importance of in situ star formation versus galaxy merging is inversely correlated, with star formation dominating the addition of stellar material below M\^* and merger accretion events dominating beyond M\^*. We find mergers have a measurable impact on the whole extent of the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF), manifest as a deepening of the `dip' in the GSMF over the next {$\sim$}Gyr and an increase in M\^* by as much as 0.01-0.05 dex.},

This is the closest black hole pair yet found by more than 2 orders of magnitude. These results are based on recent multifrequency observations using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), which reveal two compact, variable, flat-spectrum, active nuclei within the elliptical host galaxy of 0402+379. Multiepoch observations from the VLBA also provide constraints on the total mass and dynamics of the system. Low spectral resolution spectroscopy using the Hobby-Eberly Telescope indicates two velocity systems with a combined mass of the two black holes of \textasciitilde 1.5\texttimes 108 Msolar. The two nuclei appear stationary, while the jets emanating from the weaker of the two nuclei appear to move out and terminate in bright hot spots. The discovery of this system has implications for the number of close binary black holes that might be sources of gravitational radiation. Green Bank Telescope observations at 22 GHz to search for water masers in this interesting system are also presented.},

However, there is currently very little evidence for quadrupolar spatial correlations across the pulsars in the array, which is needed to make a confident claim of detection of a stochastic background. Here we give a frequentist analysis of a very simple signal+noise model showing that the current lack of evidence for spatial correlations is consistent with the magnitude of the correlation coefficients for pairs of Earth-pulsar baselines in the array, and the fact that pulsar timing arraysbare most-likely operating in the intermediate-signal regime. We derive analytic expressions that allow one to compare the expected values of the signal-to-noise ratios for both the common-spectrum and cross-correlation estimators.},

  abstract = {We compute the expected low-frequency gravitational wave signal from  coalescing massive black hole (MBH) binaries at the center of galaxies in a hierarchical structure formation scenario in which seed holes of intermediate mass form far up in the dark halo ``merger tree.'' The merger history of dark matter halos and associated MBHs is followed via cosmological Monte Carlo realizations of the merger hierarchy from redshift z=20 to the present in a {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology. MBHs get incorporated through halo mergers into larger and larger structures, sink to the center because of dynamical friction against the dark matter background, accrete cold material in the merger remnant, and form MBH binary systems. Stellar dynamical (three-body) interactions cause the hardening of the binary at large separations, while gravitational wave emission takes over at small radii and leads to the final coalescence of the pair. A simple scheme is applied in which the ``loss cone'' is constantly refilled and a constant stellar density core forms because of the ejection of stars by the shrinking binary. The integrated emission from inspiraling MBH binaries at all redshifts is computed in the quadrupole approximation and results in a gravitational wave background (GWB) with a well-defined shape that reflects the different mechanisms driving the late orbital evolution. The characteristic strain spectrum has the standard hc(f)\textasciitilde f-2/3 behavior only in the range f=10-9to10-6 Hz. At lower frequencies the orbital decay of MBH binaries is driven by the ejection of background stars (``gravitational slingshot''), and the strain amplitude increases with frequency, hc(f)\textasciitilde f. In this range the GWB is dominated by 109-1010 Msolar MBH pairs coalescing at 0{$<\sptilde$}z{$<\sptilde$}2. At higher frequencies, f{$>$}10-6Hz, the strain amplitude, as steep as hc(f)\textasciitilde f-1.3, is shaped by the convolution of last stable circular orbit emission by lighter binaries (102-107 Msolar) populating galaxy halos at all redshifts. We discuss the observability of inspiraling MBH binaries by a low-frequency gravitational wave experiment such as the planned Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Over a 3 yr observing period LISA should resolve this GWB into discrete sources, detecting \textasciitilde 60 (\textasciitilde 250) individual events above an S/N=5 (S/N=1) confidence level.},

Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) are the observational means by which we will be able to observe gravitational radiation from these systems. We carry out a systematic study of the generation of the stochastic gravitational-wave background from the cosmic population of massive black hole binaries. We consider a wide variety of assembly scenarios and we estimate the range of signal strength in the frequency band accessible to PTAs. We show that regardless of the specific model of massive black hole binaries formation and evolution, the characteristic amplitude hc of the gravitational-wave stochastic background at 10-8 Hz varies by less than a factor of 2. However, taking into account the uncertainties surrounding the actual key model parameters, the amplitude lies in the interval hc(f = 10-8Hz) \textasciitilde{} 5 \texttimes{} 10-16-8 \texttimes{} 10-15. The most optimistic predictions place the signal level at a factor of \textasciitilde 3 below the current sensitivity of PTAs, but within the detection range of the complete Parkes PTA for a wide variety of models, and of the future Square-Kilometer Array PTA for all the models considered here. We also show that at frequencies {$>\sptilde$}10-8 Hz, the frequency dependency of the generated background follows a power law significantly steeper than hc \textasciitilde{} f-2/3, which has been considered so far; the value of the spectral index depends on the actual assembly scenario and provides therefore an additional opportunity to extract astrophysical information about the cosmic population of massive black holes. Finally, we show that LISA observations of individual resolvable massive black hole binaries are complementary and orthogonal to PTA observations of a stochastic background from the whole population in the Universe. In fact, the detection of gravitational radiation in both frequency windows will enable us to fully characterize the cosmic history of massive black holes.},

We take from the literature several estimates of the redshift-dependent galaxy mass function and of the fraction of close galaxy pairs to derive a wide range of galaxy merger rates. We then exploit empirical black hole-host relations to populate merging galaxies with SMBHs. The result of our procedure is a collection of a large number of phenomenological SMBH binary merger rates consistent with current observational constraints on the galaxy assembly at z {$<$} 1.5. For each merger rate we compute the associated GW signal, eventually producing a large set of estimates of the nHz GW background that we use to infer confidence intervals of its expected amplitude. When considering the most recent SMBH-host relations, accounting for overmassive black holes in brightest cluster galaxies, we find that the nominal 1{$\sigma$} interval of the expected GW signal is only a factor of 3-10 below current PTA limits, implying a non-negligible chance of detection in the next few years.},

Programs such as the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS) or the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) surveyed millions of objects for several years, allowing variability studies on large statistical samples. The inspection of {$\approx$}250 k quasars in CRTS resulted in a catalog of 111 potentially periodic sources, put forward as supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) candidates. A similar investigation on PTF data yielded 33 candidates from a sample of {$\approx$}35 k quasars. Working under the SMBHB hypothesis, we compute the implied SMBHB merger rate and we use it to construct the expected gravitational wave background (GWB) at nano-Hz frequencies, probed by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). After correcting for incompleteness and assuming virial mass estimates, we find that the GWB implied by the CRTS sample exceeds the current most stringent PTA upper limits by almost an order of magnitude. After further correcting for the implicit bias in virial mass measurements, the implied GWB drops significantly but is still in tension with the most stringent PTA upper limits. Similar results hold for the PTF sample. Bayesian model selection shows that the null hypothesis (whereby the candidates are false positives) is preferred over the binary hypothesis at about 2.3{$\sigma$} and 3.6{$\sigma$} for the CRTS and PTF samples respectively. Although not decisive, our analysis highlights the potential of PTAs as astrophysical probes of individual SMBHB candidates and indicates that the CRTS and PTF samples are likely contaminated by several false positives.},

In this work, we present a detailed analysis of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey optical spectrum and of near-infrared (NIR) diffraction limited imaging of SDSS\textasciitilde J1431+4358. This object is a local radio-quiet type 2 active galactic nucleus (AGN) previously selected as a double AGN candidate on the basis of the double-peaked [OIII] emission line. The NIR adaptive optics-assisted observations were obtained at the Large Binocular Telescope with the LUCI+FLAO camera. We found that most of the prominent optical emission lines are characterized by a double-peaked profile, mainly produced by AGN photoionization. Our spectroscopical analysis disfavors the hypothesis that the double-peaked emission lines in the source are the signatures of outflow kinematics, leaving open the possibility that we are detecting either the rotation of a single narrow-line region or the presence of two SMBHs orbiting around a common central potential. The latter scenario is further supported by the high-spatial resolution NIR imaging: after subtracting the dominant contribution of the stellar bulge component in the host galaxy, we detect two faint nuclear sources at r{$<$}0.5 kpc projected separation. Interestingly, the two sources have a position angle consistent with that defined by the two regions where the [OIII] double peaks most likely originate. Aside from the discovery of a promising sub-kiloparsec scale dual AGN, our analysis shows the importance of an appropriate host galaxy subtraction in order to achieve a reliable estimate of the incidence of dual AGNs at small projected separations.},

  abstract = {We construct evolutionary models of the populations of active galactic  nuclei (AGNs) and supermassive black holes, in which the black hole mass function grows at the rate implied by the observed luminosity function, given assumptions about the radiative efficiency and the luminosity in Eddington units. We draw on a variety of recent X-ray and optical measurements to estimate the bolometric AGN luminosity function and compare to X-ray background data and the independent estimate of Hopkins et al. to assess remaining systematic uncertainties. The integrated AGN emissivity closely tracks the cosmic star-formation history, suggesting that star formation and black hole growth are closely linked at all redshifts. We discuss observational uncertainties in the local black hole mass function, which remain substantial, with estimates of the integrated black hole mass density {$\rho\bullet$} spanning the range 3-5.5 \texttimes{} 105 M sun Mpc-3. We find good agreement with estimates of the local mass function for a reference model where all active black holes have a fixed efficiency epsilon = 0.065 and L bol/L Edd {$\approx$} 0.4 (shifting to epsilon = 0.09, L bol/L Edd {$\approx$} 0.9 for the Hopkins et al. luminosity function). In our reference model, the duty cycle of 109 M sun black holes declines from 0.07 at z = 3 to 0.004 at z = 1 and 10-4 at z = 0. The decline is shallower for less massive black holes, a signature of "downsizing" evolution in which more massive black holes build their mass earlier. The predicted duty cycles and AGN clustering bias in this model are in reasonable accord with observational estimates. If the typical Eddington ratio declines at z {$<$} 2, then the "downsizing" of black hole growth is less pronounced. Models with reduced Eddington ratios at low redshift or black hole mass predict fewer low-mass black holes (M \textbullet{} lsim 108 M sun) in the local universe, while models with black hole mergers predict more black holes at M \textbullet{} {$>$} 109 M sun. Matching the integrated AGN emissivity to the local black hole mass density implies epsilon = 0.075 \texttimes{} ({$\rho\bullet$}/4.5 \texttimes{} 105 M sun Mpc-3)-1 for our standard luminosity function estimate, or 25\% higher for Hopkins et al.'s estimate. It is difficult to reconcile current observations with a model in which most black holes have the high efficiencies epsilon {$\approx$} 0.16-0.20 predicted by MHD simulations of disk accretion. We provide electronic tabulations of our bolometric luminosity function and our reference model predictions for black hole mass functions and duty cycles as a function of redshift.},

The constraints are based on an observational compilation that includes observations in the rest-frame IR, B band, UV, soft, and hard X-ray in past decades. Our method follows Hopkins et al. with an updated quasar SED model and bolometric and extinction corrections. The new best-fitting bolometric quasar luminosity function behaves qualitatively different from the old Hopkins model at high redshift. Compared with the old model, the number density normalization decreases towards higher redshift and the bright-end slope is steeper at z {$\greaterequivlnt$} 2. Due to the paucity of measurements at the faint end, the faint end slope at z {$\greaterequivlnt$} 5 is quite uncertain. We present two models, one featuring a progressively steeper faint-end slope at higher redshift and the other featuring a shallow faint-end slope at z {$\greaterequivlnt$} 5. Further multiband observations of the faint-end QLF are needed to distinguish between these models. The evolutionary pattern of the bolometric QLF can be interpreted as an early phase likely dominated by the hierarchical assembly of structures and a late phase likely dominated by the quenching of galaxies. We explore the implications of this model on the ionizing photon production by quasars, the CXB spectrum, the SMBH mass density, and mass functions. The predicted hydrogen photoionization rate contributed by quasars is subdominant during the epoch of reionization and only becomes important at z {$\lessequivlnt$} 3. The predicted CXB spectrum, cosmic SMBH mass density, and SMBH mass function are generally consistent with existing observations.},

Identifying post-merger-scale (i.e., {$<\sptilde$}a few kpc) dual SMBHs is a critical pathway to understanding their dynamical evolution and successive mergers. While serendipitously discovering kpc-scale dual SMBHs at z{$<$}1 is possible, such systems are elusive at z{$>$}2, but critical to constraining the progenitors of SMBH mergers. The redshift z\textasciitilde 2 also marks the epoch of peak activity of luminous quasars, hence probing this spatial regime at high redshift is of particular significance in understanding the evolution of quasars. However, given stringent resolution requirements, there is currently no confirmed {$<$}10 kpc physical SMBH pair at z{$>$}2. Here we report two sub-arcsec double quasars at z{$>$}2 discovered from a targeted search with a novel astrometric technique, demonstrating a high success rate (\textasciitilde 50\%) in this systematic approach. These high-redshift double quasars could be the long-sought kpc-scale dual SMBHs, or sub-arcsec gravitationally-lensed quasar images. One of these double quasars (at z=2.95) was spatially resolved with optical spectroscopy, and slightly favors the scenario of a physical quasar pair with a projected separation of 3.5 kpc (0.46"). Follow-up observations of double quasars discovered by this targeted approach will be able to provide the first observational constraints on kpc-scale dual SMBHs at z{$>$}2.},

  abstract = {Approximately 1\% of low-redshift (z {$<\sptilde$} 0.3) optically selected type 2  active galactic nuclei (AGNs) show a double-peaked [O III] narrow emission line profile in their spatially integrated spectra. Such features are usually interpreted as either due to kinematics, such as biconical outflows and/or disk rotation of the narrow line region (NLR) around single black holes, or due to the relative motion of two distinct NLRs in a merging pair of AGNs. Here, we report follow-up near-infrared (NIR) imaging and optical slit spectroscopy of 31 double-peaked [O III] type 2 AGNs drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) parent sample presented in Liu et al. The NIR imaging traces the old stellar population in each galaxy, while the optical slit spectroscopy traces the NLR gas. These data reveal a mixture of origins for the double-peaked feature. Roughly 10\% of our objects are best explained by binary AGNs at (projected) kpc-scale separations, where two stellar components with spatially coincident NLRs are seen. \textasciitilde 50\% of our objects have [O III] emission offset by a few kpc, corresponding to the two velocity components seen in the SDSS spectra, but there are no spatially coincident double stellar components seen in the NIR imaging. For those objects with sufficiently high-quality slit spectra, we see velocity and/or velocity dispersion gradients in [O III] emission, suggestive of the kinematic signatures of a single NLR. The remaining \textasciitilde 40\% of our objects are ambiguous and will need higher spatial resolution observations to distinguish between the two scenarios. Our observations therefore favor the kinematics scenario with a single AGN for the majority of these double-peaked [O III] type 2 AGNs. We emphasize the importance of combining imaging and slit spectroscopy in identifying kpc-scale binary AGNs, i.e., in no cases does one of these alone allow an unambiguous identification. We estimate that \textasciitilde 0.5\%-2.5\% of the z {$<\sptilde$} 0.3 type 2 AGNs are kpc-scale binary AGNs of comparable luminosities, with a relative orbital velocity {$>\sptilde$} 150 km s-1. Based in part on observations obtained with the 6.5 m Magellan telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile, and with the Apache Point Observatory 3.5 m telescope, which is owned and operated by the Astrophysical Research Consortium.},

  abstract = {Pulsar timing arrays are now setting increasingly tight limits on the gravitational wave background from binary supermassive black holes. But as upper limits grow more constraining, what can be implied about galaxy evolution? We investigate which astrophysical parameters have the largest impact on strain spectrum predictions and provide a simple framework to directly translate between measured values for the parameters of galaxy evolution and PTA limits on the gravitational wave background of binary supermassive black holes. We find that the most influential observable is the relation between a host galaxy's central bulge and its central black hole, M\textbullet -Mbulge, which has the largest effect on the mean value of the characteristic strain amplitude. However, the variance of each prediction is dominated by uncertainties in the galaxy stellar mass function. Using this framework with the best published PTA limit, we can set limits on the shape and scatter of the M\textbullet -Mbulge relation. We find our limits to be in contention with strain predictions using two leading measurements of this relation. We investigate several possible reasons for this disagreement. If we take the M\textbullet -Mbulge relations to be correct within a simple power-law model for the gravitational wave background, then the inconsistency is reconcilable by allowing for an additional ``stalling'' time between a galaxy merger and evolution of a binary supermassive black hole to sub-parsec scales, with lower limits on this timescale of {$\sim$} 1 - 2 Gyr.},

BLAGNs are selected from the COSMOS and CDF-S fields, and span the redshift range 0.2{$\leq$}slant z\textbackslash lt 2.1. Black hole masses are calculated using archival spectroscopy and single-epoch virial mass estimators, and galaxy total stellar masses are calculated by fitting the spectral energy distribution (subtracting the BLAGN component). The mass-growth rates of both the black hole and galaxy are calculated using Chandra/XMM-Newton X-ray and Herschel far-infrared data, reliable measures of the BLAGN accretion and galaxy star formation rates, respectively. We use Monte Carlo simulations to account for biases in our sample, due to both selection limits and the steep slope of the massive end of the galaxy stellar-mass distribution. We find our sample is consistent with no evolution in the \{\{M\}BH\}-\{\{M\}*\} relation from z {$\sim$} 2 to z {$\sim$} 0. BLAGNs and their host galaxies which lie off the black hole mass-galaxy total stellar mass relation tend to have evolutionary vectors anti-correlated with their mass ratios: that is, galaxies with over-massive (under-massive) black holes tend to have a low (high) ratio of the specific accretion rate to the specific star formation rate. We also use the measured growth rates to estimate the preferred AGN duty cycle for our galaxies to evolve most consistently onto the local \{\{M\}BH\}-\{\{M\}Bul\} relation. Under reasonable assumptions of exponentially declining star formation histories, the data suggest a non-evolving (no more than a factor of a few) BLAGN duty cycle among star-forming galaxies of {$\sim$}10\% (1{$\sigma$} range of 1-42\% at z\textbackslash lt 1 and 2-34\% at z\textbackslash gt 1).},

The MGC spheroid luminosities are based on R1/n bulge plus exponential-disc decompositions. The majority of black hole masses reside between 106Msolar and an upper limit of 2 \texttimes{} 109Msolar. Using previously determined space-density weights, we derive the SMBH mass function which we fit with a Schechter-like function. Integrating the black hole mass function over 106 {$<$} Mbh/Msolar {$<$} 1010 gives an SMBH mass density of (3.8 +/- 0.6) \texttimes{} 105h370Msolar Mpc-3 for early-type galaxies and (0.96 +/- 0.2) \texttimes{} 105h370Msolar Mpc-3 for late-type galaxies. The errors are estimated from Monte Carlo simulations which include the uncertainties in the Mbh-L relation, the luminosity of the host spheroid and the intrinsic scatter of the Mbh-L relation. Assuming SMBHs form via baryonic accretion, we find that (0.008 +/- 0.002)h370 per cent of the Universe's baryons are currently locked up in SMBHs. This result is consistent with our previous estimate based on the Mbh-n (S\'ersic index) relation.},

Here we show that if both cosmic strings and PBHs are present, their interaction leads to a range of interesting consequences. At the time of their formation, the PBHs get attached to the strings and influence their evolution, leading to the formation of black-hole-string networks and commonly to the suppression of loop production in a range of redshifts. Subsequently, reconnections within the network give rise to small nets made of several black holes and connecting strings. The number of black holes in the network as well as the stability of the nets depend on the topological properties of the strings. The nets oscillate and shrink exponentially due to the emission of gravitational waves. This leads to potentially observable string-driven mergers of PBHs. The strings can keep PBHs from galactic halos, making the current bounds on PBHs not generally applicable. Alternatively, heavy PBHs can drag low-tension strings into the centers of galaxies. The superconducting strings can appear as radio filaments pointing towards supermassive black holes.},

  abstract = {We assess models for the assembly of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at  the center of galaxies that trace their hierarchical buildup far up in the dark halo ``merger tree.'' Motivated by the recent discovery of luminous quasars around redshift z\textasciitilde 6-suggesting a very early assembly epoch-and by numerical simulations of the fragmentation of primordial molecular clouds in cold dark matter (CDM) cosmogonies, we assume that the first ``seed'' black holes (BHs) had intermediate masses and formed in (mini)halos collapsing at z\textasciitilde 20 from high-{$\sigma$} density fluctuations. As these pregalactic holes become incorporated through a series of mergers into larger and larger halos, they sink to the center because of dynamical friction, accrete a fraction of the gas in the merger remnant to become supermassive, form a binary system, and eventually coalesce. The merger history of dark matter halos and associated BHs is followed by cosmological Monte Carlo realizations of the merger hierarchy from early times until the present in a {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology. A simple model, where quasar activity is driven by major mergers and SMBHs accrete at the Eddington rate a mass that scales with the fifth power of the circular velocity of the host halo, is shown to reproduce the observed luminosity function of optically selected quasars in the redshift range 1-2 is promptly regenerated after every major merger event, replenishing the mass displaced by the binary. Triple BH interactions will inevitably take place at early times if the formation route for the assembly of SMBHs goes back to the very first generation of stars, and we follow them in our merger tree. The assumptions underlying our scenario lead to the prediction of a population of massive BHs wandering in galaxy halos and the intergalactic medium at the present epoch and contributing {$<\sptilde$}10\% to the total BH mass density, {$\rho$}SMBH=4\texttimes 105 Msolar Mpc-3 (h=0.7). The fraction of binary SMBHs in galaxy nuclei is on the order of 10\% today, and it increases with redshift so that almost all massive nuclear BHs at early epochs are in binary systems. The fraction of binary quasars (both members brighter than 0.1L*) instead is less than 0.3\% at all epochs. The nuclear SMBH occupation fraction is unity (0.6) at the present epoch if the first seed BHs were as numerous as the 3.5 {$\sigma$} (4 {$\sigma$}) density peaks at z=20.},

To study these events in the cosmological context, we need to trace the large-scale structure and cosmic evolution of a statistical population of galaxies, from dim dwarfs to bright galaxies. To cover such a large range of galaxy masses, we analyse two complementary simulations: HORIZON-AGN with a large volume and low resolution that tracks the high-mass ( \$\textbackslash gt 10\^7\textbackslash, \{\textbackslash rm M\_\textbackslash odot \}\$ ) MBH population, and NEWHORIZON with a smaller volume but higher resolution that traces the low-mass (  \$\textbackslash lt 10\^7\textbackslash, \{\textbackslash rm M\_\textbackslash odot \}\$ ) MBH population. While HORIZON-AGN can be used to estimate the rate of inspirals for pulsar timing arrays, NEWHORIZON investigate MBH mergers in a statistical sample of dwarf galaxies for LISA, which is sensitive to low-mass MBHs. We use the same method to analyse the two simulations, post-processing MBH dynamics to account for time delays mostly determined by dynamical friction and stellar hardening. In both simulations, MBHs typically merge long after galaxies do, so that the galaxy morphology at the time of the MBH merger is no longer determined by the structural disturbances engendered by the galaxy merger from which the MBH coalescence has originated. These time delays cause a loss of high-z MBH coalescences, shifting the peak of the MBH merger rate to z {$\sim$} 1-2. This study shows how tracking MBH mergers in low-mass galaxies is crucial to probing the MBH merger rate for LISA and investigate the properties of the host galaxies.},

The synthetic BHs reproduce a variety of observational constraints such as the redshift evolution of the BH mass density and the mass function. Strong self-regulation via AGN feedback, weak supernova feedback, and unresolved internal processes result in a tight BH-galaxy mass correlation. Starting at z {$\sim$} 2, tidal stripping creates a small population of BHs over-massive with respect to the halo. The fraction of galaxies hosting a central BH or an AGN increases with stellar mass. The AGN fraction agrees better with multi-wavelength studies, than single-wavelength ones, unless obscuration is taken into account. The most massive haloes present BH multiplicity, with additional BHs gained by ongoing or past mergers. In some cases, both a central and an off-centre AGN shine concurrently, producing a dual AGN. This dual AGN population dwindles with decreasing redshift, as found in observations. Specific accretion rate and Eddington ratio distributions are in good agreement with observational estimates. The BH population is dominated in turn by fast, slow, and very slow accretors, with transitions occurring at z = 3 and z = 2, respectively.},

To date, only two candidates have been selected in a sample comprising 17,500 sources selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Quasar Catalog at z {$<$} 0.70. In this Letter, we use models of assembly and growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in hierarchical cosmologies to study the statistics and observability of binary quasars at sub-parsec separations. Our goal is twofold: (1) to test if such a scarce number of binaries is consistent with theoretical prediction of SMBH merger rates and (2) to provide additional predictions at higher redshifts and at lower flux levels. We determine the cumulative number of expected binaries in a complete volume-limited sample. Motivated by Boroson \& Lauer, we apply the SDSS quasar luminosity cut (Mi {$<$} -22) to our theoretical sample, deriving an upper limit to the observable binary fraction. We find that sub-parsec quasar binaries are intrinsically rare. Our best models predict \textasciitilde 0.01 deg-2 sub-parsec binary quasars with separations below \textasciitilde 104 Schwarzschild radii (v orb {$>$} 2000 kms) at z {$<$} 0.7, which represent a fraction \textasciitilde 6 \texttimes{} 10-4 of unabsorbed quasars in our theoretical sample. In a complete sample of \textasciitilde 10,000 sources, we therefore predict an upper limit of \textasciitilde 10 sub-parsec binary quasars. The number of binaries increases rapidly with increasing redshift. The decreasing lifetime with SMBH binary mass suggests that lowering the luminosity threshold does not lead to a significant increase in the number of detectable sub-parsec binary quasars.},

Five of these offset AGN exhibit double-peaked broad Balmer emission from an unobscured accretion disk and four show radio emission indicative of a relativistic jet. The fraction of double-peaked emitters in our spatially offset AGN sample is significantly larger than the 16\textbackslash\% double-peaked emitter fraction observed for ZTF AGN overall. In our sample of variable AGN we also identified 52 merging galaxies, including a new spectroscopically confirmed dual AGN. Finally, we detected the dramatic rebrightening of SDSS1133, a previously discovered variable object and recoiling SMBH candidate, in ZTF.

  abstract = {The coalescence of massive black hole (BH) binaries due to galaxy  mergers provides a primary source of low-frequency gravitational radiation detectable by pulsar timing measurements and by the proposed the Laser Interferometry Space Antenna (LISA) observatory. We compute the expected gravitational radiation signal from sources at all redshifts by combining the predicted merger rate of galactic halos with recent measurements of the relation between BH mass, MBH, and the velocity dispersion of its host galaxy, {$\sigma$}. Our main findings are as follows: (1) the nHz frequency background is dominated by BH binaries at redshifts z{$<\sptilde$}2, and existing limits from pulsar timing data place tight constraints on the allowed normalization and power-law slope of the MBH-{$\sigma$} relation or on the fraction of BH binaries that proceed to coalescence; (2) more than half of all discrete mHz massive BH sources detectable by LISA are likely to originate at redshifts z{$>\sptilde$}7 (3) the number of LISA sources per unit redshift per year should drop substantially after reionization as long as BH formation is triggered by gas cooling in galaxies. Studies of the highest redshift sources among the few hundred detectable events per year will provide unique information about the physics and history of black hole growth in galaxies.},

  abstract = {We present results of a statistical study of the cosmic evolution of the  mass-dependent major-merger rate since z = 1. A stellar mass limited sample of close major-merger pairs (the CPAIR sample) was selected from the archive of the COSMOS survey. Pair fractions at different redshifts derived using the CPAIR sample and a local K-band-selected pair sample show no significant variations with stellar mass. The pair fraction exhibits moderately strong cosmic evolution, with the best-fitting function of f pair = 10-1.88({$\pm$} 0.03)(1 + z)2.2({$\pm$} 0.2). The best-fitting function for the merger rate is R mg (Gyr-1) = 0.053 \texttimes{} (Mstar/1010.7 M{$\odot$} )0.3(1 + z)2.2/(1 + z/8). This rate implies that galaxies of M star \textasciitilde{} 1010-1011.5 M {$\odot$} have undergone \textasciitilde 0.5-1.5 major mergers since z = 1. Our results show that, for massive galaxies (M star {$>$}= 1010.5 M {$\odot$}) at z {$<$}= 1, major mergers involving star-forming galaxies (i.e., wet and mixed mergers) can account for the formation of both ellipticals and red quiescent galaxies (RQGs). On the other hand, major mergers cannot be responsible for the formation of most low mass ellipticals and RQGs of M star {$<\sptilde$} 1010.3 M {$\odot$}. Our quantitative estimates indicate that major mergers have significant impact on the stellar mass assembly of the most massive galaxies (M star {$>$}= 1011.3 M {$\odot$}), but for less massive galaxies the stellar mass assembly is dominated by the star formation. Comparison with the mass-dependent (ultra)luminous infrared galaxies ((U)LIRG) rates suggests that the frequency of major-merger events is comparable to or higher than that of (U)LIRGs.},

  abstract = {We present a new realization of the resonant production of primordial black holes as well as gravitational waves in a two-stage inflation model consisting of a scalar field \textbackslash phi with an axion-monodromy-like periodic structure in the potential that governs the first stage and another field \textbackslash chi with a hilltop-like potential that dominates the second stage. The parametric resonance seeded by the periodic structure at the first stage amplifies the perturbations of both fields inside the Hubble radius. While the evolution of the background trajectory experiences a turn as the oscillatory barrier height increases, the amplified perturbations of \textbackslash chi remain as they are and contribute to the final curvature perturbation. It turns out that the primordial power spectrum displays a significant resonant peak on small scales, which can lead to an abundant production of primordial black holes. Furthermore, gravitational waves are also generated from the resonantly enhanced field perturbations during inflation, the amplitude of which may be constrained by future gravitational wave interferometers.},
